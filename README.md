# Introduction
Open the covid19_analysis dashboard in Binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JayVeezy1/CS50_final_project/master?urlpath=voila%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks)

The project 'covid19_analysis.ipynb' is saved in the 'notebooks' folder. You can download it to use it for your own analysis or local Voila dashboard.

If you intend to build a Voila-Dashboard on your own PC, just download the .ipynb file. Next you have to install the Voila package on your local Python Version (e.g. in the command line: ‘pip install voila’). Now you can start the dashboard on your local machine by using the command line: ‘voila “~/path/to/notebook/covid19_analysis.ipynb” ‘. Stay safe and good luck!

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further requiries or feedback.
The dashboard setup was inspired by the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FngV4VdYrkA&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=DataSciencewithHarshit
